                    <p>The Blood Knight is a greatsword-wielding vampire who grows stronger with every enemy he slays, 
                        feeding on their blood to fuel his dark power. 
                        As he absorbs more blood, his strength grows, 
                        allowing him to use increasingly devastating attacks the more blood he consumes.
                        (I also did not end up fully finishing this drawing)

                    <div class="List">
                        <ul>
                            <li>Passive ability “Crimson Pact” – The Blood Knight has a meter of how much blood he has consumed in the last 30 seconds. Whenever the Blood Knight damages an enemy, he marks them with Haemorrhage, making them bleed over time.
                                Killing Haemorrhaging enemies absorbs their blood, restoring HP and fills a portion of the Blood meter.
                                The more you fuel the Blood Meter the more damage you do to enemies marked with Haemorrhage. As the meter gets filled the blood Knights abilities gain bonus effects.
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Sanguine Cleave - A wide horizontal slash that extends further based on the number of Haemorrhaging enemies in the AoE.
                                <br>When the Blood meter is filled 1 third of the way it doubles the range and applies Haemorrhage to all enemies hit.
                                <br>When the Blood meter is filled 2 thirds of the way the attack becomes a spinning strike, dealing massive AoE damage and restoring HP based on enemies hit.
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Crimson Chains - Chains latch onto all nearby enemies, dragging them into melee range.
                                <br>When the Blood meter is filled 2 thirds of the way the enemies dragged in are briefly stunned and take increased damage from the Blood Knight for a few seconds.
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Exsanguinate - Causes all Haemorrhaging enemies in an area to bleed out instantly, dealing burst damage. This ability fully drains the Blood meter.
                                <br>When the Blood meter is 1 third of the way filled a portion of the damage is converted into a blood shield coating the Blood Knight.
                                <br>When the blood meter is full the shield explodes after it is diminished, spreading Haemorrhage to all nearby enemies.
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Vampiric wings – The Blood Knight turns into a bat for up to 5 seconds that has extremely increased movement speed. If you exit the bat manually the Blood Knight slams the ground with his great sword dealing AoE damage, if an enemy is in the centre of the AoE they take massively increased damage.
                                <br>When the Blood meter is filled 1 third of the way the AoE applies Haemorrhage to all enemies hit.
                                <br>When the blood meter is full summon 6 other Blood Swords that also slam the ground that all have their own AoE and AoE damage.
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Throne of Blood – The Blood Knight summons 4 Blood clones of himself for a duration that copy all of his movements and attacks and deal 50% less damage than the Blood Knight.
                                During this ability the Blood Knight gains life steal, Increased attack speed and builds the Blood meter quicker.
                                Killing Haemorrhaged enemies extends the duration (with diminishing returns).
                                <br>When blood meter is filled 2 thirds of the way the Blood Knight summons 6 clones.
                                <br>When Blood meter is full all abilities have reduced cooldown while this ability is active.
                            </li>
