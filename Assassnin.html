                    <p>The Assassin will carry 2 daggers, that specialise in applying
                        a debuff to enemies that will allow the Assassin to deal extremely
                        high crit damage. However, the daggers cannot crit so the Assassin
                        relies on his high damaging abilities to make use of his crit chance.
