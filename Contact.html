                <div class="Section3"><p>To make all the art for this website I bought a Ugee drawing pad I think i got the 11 inch variant. I also downloaded Krita for the first time as my only
                    background in drawing was on paper. Make sure to download drivers for your drawing pad lol i spent so long in settings trying to a fix a delay with the pen, it was just the drivers.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The guide above goes through practically everything you need to know and was a great source of information for the tools that Krita provides which made the drawing process a million times faster
                    I would not have been able to do this assignment without this video.

                    <p>This is a video series i also found very helpful, i obviously didnt watch all 55 videos in the series but it was a great resource when i wanted to know something specific and i could serach through
                        the list of videos to find the one i need.
