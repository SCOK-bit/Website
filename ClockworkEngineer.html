                <p>The Clockwork Engineer wields an arcane-infused pistol and a mechanical gauntlet, 
                    relying on gadgets, turrets, and time manipulation to be effective in combat. 
                    While his basic attacks are weak, 
                    his abilities become more powerful over time through Overcharging, 
                    allowing for devastating burst damage and utility-based combos.
