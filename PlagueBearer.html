                <p>The Plague bearer exists to spread disease and decay, 
                    thriving as his infection spreads to everything in his path. 
                    The more enemies he corrupts with rot, the stronger he becomes. 
                    As his plague spreads uncontrollably, 
                    he can trigger devasting chain reactions, 
                    wiping out hordes while instantly spreading their disease and rot to the next.
                </p>
                <h1>Abilities</h1>
                <div class="List">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Passive ability “Epidemic” – The plague Bearer has an aura of disease that automatically spreads small amounts of rot continuously to nearby enemies in his aura. Rot is a stacking damage over time.
                            If an enemy dies while afflicted with max stacks of Rot, their corpse explodes in a Plague Burst, dealing AoE damage and infecting nearby enemies with some of the deceased’s remaining Rot stacks.
                            Enemies that reach max Rot stacks become Plague-Ridden, receiving increased damage from the Plague bearer’s abilities.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Withering Grasp - The Plague bearer latches onto an enemy, channelling for a short duration while amplifying their Rot stacks. 
                            The afflicted enemy takes increased Rot damage during the channel. If they die while grasped, they explode, spreading max Rot stacks to enemies in range. 
                            <br>If fully Plague-Ridden enemies die to this, their explosion has a higher radius and applies Weaken to all nearby enemies.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Pestilent surge - The Plague bearer releases a virulent wave of filth in a cone, instantly applying Rot stacks to all enemies hit. 
                            Enemies already affected by Rot spread it further to nearby enemies. 
                            <br>If at least one enemy reaches max Rot stacks, the cooldown is partially refunded.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Blighted Husk - The Plague bearer sheds his decayed flesh, becoming briefly immune to damage while purging himself of all active debuffs and healing himself a small amount for every Plague-ridden enemy in range of him. 
                            <br>Any nearby enemies affected by Rot are slowed and take additional damage for a few seconds. 
                            <br>The next time the Plague bearer applies Rot after using this ability, he applies an additional burst of stacks.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Septic Thralls - The Plague bearer revives up to 10 nearby corpses into decaying thralls that chase down and infect enemies.
                            <br>When they reach an enemy, they burst, dealing damage in an area and spreading max Rot stacks.
                            <br>If no corpses are available, the Plague bearer can sacrifice his own health to create thralls from his own rotting flesh.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>PlagueBringer - The Plague bearer expels all current Rot stacks in a massive toxic eruption, dealing devastating damage based on total stacks across all enemies. 
                            <br>Any enemy that dies from this explosion becomes a Plague Husk, which seeks the nearest enemy before detonating in a secondary burst. 
                            <br>The Plague bearer heals himself for 1% max HP for every rot stack expelled with this ability, with the ability to over cap his health to 200% if enough rot stacks are expelled.
                            <br>If at least 30 enemies die from the plague explosion, the cooldown is reduced by 50%.
                        </li>
